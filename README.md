For more detailed information and explanations about functionality, please refer to the Maple Calendar Description.pdf.

If you intend on running it, you must run it through a server. I used Apache Tomcat, but it should work on any other server of your choice. Also, the application is meant to be run at 1440x1028 resolution on the browser. 

<h2> tl;dr </h2>
Maple Calendar adds some unique social networking functionalities to a typical calendar application. Not only are you able to see all upcoming events in a clean format, but you can also see other user's events based on following/unfollowing relationships. This application utilizes the Google Calendar API to retrieve basic profile and event information, as well as make changes to the Google Calendar by adding new events.
