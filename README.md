<h2> tl;dr </h2>
Maple Calendar adds some unique social networking functionalities to a typical calendar application. Not only are you able to see all upcoming events in a clean format, but you can also see other user's events based on following/unfollowing relationships. This application utilizes the Google Calendar API to retrieve basic profile and event information, as well as make changes to the Google Calendar by adding new events.
